## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
- the row is the object and the column is the data in the row.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
- CREATE TABLE characters (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  age VARCHAR(255),
  description VARCHAR(255)
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
- drop will remove the table completely
